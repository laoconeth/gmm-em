# TA Session: K-means and Gaussian Mixture EM Practice

This repository contains code for the practice session of the KAIST Graduate School of AI - Samsung Electronics DS Non-Degree Program.

## Overview

The code implements practical exercises for two important algorithms in unsupervised learning:
- **K-means Clustering**: A simple yet powerful clustering technique.
- **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)** with Expectation Maximization (EM): A probabilistic model used for clustering, relying on the EM algorithm for parameter estimation.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
